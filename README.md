## Introduction

This project serves as a foundational database structure for an Instagram clone. It includes tables and relationships for managing user profiles, posts, comments, and likes. The goal is to provide a structured and efficient database design that can be used as a starting point for building the backend of an Instagram-like application.

## Database Schema

The database schema is organized into the following tables:

1. **Users**: Stores user profile information, including username, email, password hash, and profile picture URL.
2. **Posts**: Contains information about each post, including the user who created it, the post's content, timestamp, and image URL.
3. **Comments**: Stores comments made on posts, with details like the commenter's ID, the post being commented on, the comment text, and the timestamp.
4. **Likes**: Records likes on posts, linking the user who liked the post and the post itself.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you can use this database, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Database Management System (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)](link-to-database-system)
- [Database Client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin)](link-to-client)
- [SQL Script Runner (e.g., `psql`, `mysql`, `sqlite3`)](link-to-script-runner)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/instagram-clone-database.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd instagram-clone-database
   ```

3. Run the SQL script to create the database schema:

   ```shell
   # Replace with your database system's script runner command
   script-runner -f schema.sql
   ```

## Usage

### Database Initialization

To initialize the database schema, follow the installation steps mentioned above.

### Running Queries

You can interact with the database by running SQL queries using your preferred database client. Here are some common queries you might want to execute:

- Retrieve user information:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = 'example_user';
  ```

- Retrieve posts by a specific user:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Posts WHERE user_id = 1;
  ```

- Add a new post:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Posts (user_id, content, image_url) VALUES (1, 'This is a sample post', 'image_url_here');
  ```

- Retrieve comments on a post:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Comments WHERE post_id = 1;
  ```

- Add a comment to a post:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Comments (user_id, post_id, comment_text) VALUES (1, 1, 'Great post!');
  ```

- Record a like on a post:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Likes (user_id, post_id) VALUES (1, 1);
  ```
